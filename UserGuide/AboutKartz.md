# About Kartz

Due to the advancement of science and technology, people have been changing their  
shopping practices over the past decade and a half (Digital Silk, 2021). “The attraction of online  
shopping is significantly growing because people can utilize their valuable time for their family  
and personal care. People can also save their travel time as well as the time to decide on  
selecting the preferred products while staying at home (Digital Silk, 2021)”. In this scenario,  
Kartz is created to allow users to gather the items that they want to purchase and keep track of  
the history of items that they will be purchased from. Kartz will encourage a mother, teacher,  
student, business professional, or any regular online shoppers who have passion as well as a  
habit of procuring items from various websites and would like to organize in a specific way. On  
the one hand, for fast and interactive user interfaces, the react app will be used as frontend  
within a script library. On the other hand, flask app will contribute as a backend application  
framework for scaling up the application’s complexity. Likewise, Microsoft Azure will be utilized  
in the web application to host an SQL database and the database will be applied to hold user  
profile data as well as the user’s cart items. According to Digital Silk, “In 2021, one of the  
challenges of online shopping is shopping cart abandonment. Digital Silk states that online  
shoppers abandon their shopping carts 68% of the time and some stores can see the rates as  
high as 80% (Digital Silk, 2021)”. So, the challenges are not only how to cut down on cart  
abandonment but also keeping track of each purchase made through the application.
