## **Project Sought**
The capstone project I will be seeking is something that I feel can demonstrate my skillset I have aquired over the years. I am looking into making a React based project that will be able to combine shopping lists from different websites. The benefit of this will be that it would be able to track stock drops and price fluctuations and give a user notifications in order to make the best purchase for themselves. Another project that I find interesting that I am looking into is creating some type of Unity based game. I do not have any prior experience so this would be used to self learn and make something I am passionate about.
