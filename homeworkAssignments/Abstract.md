# Project Abstract

In 2020, over two billion people purchased goods or services online, and during the same year, e-retail 
sales surpassed 4.2 trillion U.S. dollars worldwide. Also, in the year of the pandemic, global 
retail e-commerce sales grew by more than 25 percent (E-commerce worldwide, 2022). Because of technical 
improvements and the ability to have most items delivered to their homes or ready for pickup promptly 
after purchase, millions of people use online shopping services. The issue with having so many online 
markets is that the end-user lacked the ability to organize their online purchased items. The Kartz application 
helped end-users by providing a location where they can keep track of their items organized in one place. The 
user can add, modify, and delete items in the items list using the application. Kartz has had an impact on the 
online shopping business by streamlining and organizing the process of online shopping.
